# Firmware for the openair boards


## In the ESP32_board directory you will find the current firmware for Version 1.1 of the board
You will need to install the ESP32 Board and the used Libs in your Arduino App.

Instructions for installing the Arduino-ESP32 core for the Arduino IDE can be found here: <https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32#installation-instructions>

You'll need to add the sensor library from <https://github.com/sensebox/SDS011-select-serial>. The other dependencies can be picked directly from `Manage Libraries` in the IDE.

Selecting ESP32 Dev board in Board Manager should work fine.

## In the feather_boards directory we have the firmware for boardversion 0.0
